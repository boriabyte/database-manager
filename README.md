# DATABASE MANAGEMENT WEB APPLICATION

My first major application written in C# with its ASP.NET Core framework for web development. Dabbled a little in its MVC & Razor pages variants but settled on Core for its simplicity and straightforwardness (I was also behind on the assignment and didn't have time to properly
learn MVC and Razor pages :P).

Used a big main class where I routed the gathered data from MySQL Workbench database to the endpoints, from which I got the data website-side using simple JavaScript. Used HTML5 for web design, simple CSS with its @keyframes feautre for animations and better
interactivity.
